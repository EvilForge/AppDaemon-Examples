# AppDaemon-Examples
My HomeAssistant (Hassio) AppDaemon Examples

## Overview:
HomeAssistant is a great piece of software, but I keep hitting issues with automations. I get the direction they are going in, make it easier to set up things, create automation, etc. But I find that my initial set of automations can be improved (add intelligence, tweak them to save more energy, make them less annoying when i dont want them to run in exceptional circumstances, etc).

And that gets complicated really quick in the default automation toolset.  

And than, I found "AppDaemon"!

But its a learning curve. and some of the examples don't work for me. Syntax errors, perhaps some from the changing versions of the plugin, etc... and learning Python isn't hard but its not my day-to-day language. 

So, since I built some of these scripts for my use, and they appear to work.. and they aren't exactly like the examples the author provided.. here they are!

The code is in initial stages with most of the scripts I need working.. so.. here's the first upload.

NOTE this is a pet project, so updates may be intermittent.

## Requirements:
This is just the script parts. You need to install AppDaemon and of course have a fully functional HomeAssistant setup. And be familar with working all of that.. might help to know some python, or at least know how to find help for python using google!

Hope these help you.. If you feel like it, feel free to [buy me a coffee!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rbef)
